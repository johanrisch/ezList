# ezList
ezList is JS module that gives you the most out of an HTML-table.


## Usage
ezList is meant to be easy to use and with minimal to not configurations needed to get a first version up and running. ezList will pretty much set up everything to work without any of the options defined (except for the control container id). However, this will lead to a bit more of a hazzle once some cosumizations are made. 

If the table id is not given ezList will take the first table on the page. Wether the table is given or not ezList will always take the first row inside the <thead> tag, so you must always use this tag. All items (rows) of the table will be fetched from the first <tbody> tag which gives us our second requirement.
